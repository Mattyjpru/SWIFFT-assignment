In my testing, I utilize two lists of primes(one is a list of twin primes)
sourced from https://prime-numbers.info/
I made three tests in total. One that checks that all outputs of lists of primes
and twin primes generated by the sieve of eratosthenes an twin primes functions 
are in fact primes. It does this by switching a flag if any factor other than 1
can be found from 2-the number for each number in the list, indicating that the number
is only divisible by 1 and itself. This is the definition of a prime.
then, to make sure that the two functions generate all of the primes and twin primes,
I utilized the lists sourced from the site mentioned above. Prime numbers are a well
documented list of mathematical figures all the way out to 2^(82,589,933)âˆ’1 and so are
readily availabe from many sources and can be generated by various algorithms, so I
felt that this site (being solely dedicated to information about prime numbers) was
sufficiently credible. I also handwrote the first 100 primes (which yielded 15 twin primes) 
and compared them to the sourced lists. Using this source, I compared every entry in the lists 
generated by each function to the sourced lists and switched a flag if the entry in 
both the generated and sourced lists were not the same. I have now shown that every entry in
each genereated list is in fact prime, and that all possible primes and twwin primes
were generated by comparing them to sourced lists.
